# Responsive Web App - Collaborative project

# App Name: PhotoMatch

* The project consists of a responsive web app created with a collaborative project.
* The aim of the project is to create a simple web app accessible from any device, which allows the user after logging in and having loaded images (from the memory, or from the camera of his device in the case of mobile), to read a result, which returns the content of the uploaded images (or images)

# What did we do?

* With the input of our TomorrowDevs mentors we created a Responsive Web App that allows the user to load one or more photos from his / her laptop or phone

# How did we create the web app?

# What technologies did we use?

# What working methodology and tools did we use?

* We used a Figma's prototype to have a template to stick to. Link: https://bit.ly/3pamv5s
* We worked through **AGILE METHODOLOGY**. Each task was created as an issue of Github and reported onto a Github Projects board linked to the repository.
* We tracked time spent on the activities with Toggl tracker
* We used a Jitsi room for our calls, however, in the spirit of **AGILE METHODOLOGY** we tried to keep all the communications as asynchrounous as possible
* A standbot on our Slack channel was used to manage our daily stand-ups and keep communications asynchronous
